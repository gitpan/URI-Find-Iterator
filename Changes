2004-08-19 0.4   Switch from $` and $' 

	From the perlre man manpage:
	"WARNING: Once Perl sees that you need one of $&, $`, or $' anywhere
    in the program, it has to provide them for every pattern match. This 
    may substantially slow your program. Perl uses the same mechanism to 
    produce $1, $2, etc, so you also pay a price for each pattern that 
    contains capturing parentheses. (To avoid this cost while retaining 
    the grouping behaviour, use the extended regular expression (?: ... 
    ) instead.) But if you never use $&, $` or $', then patterns without 
    capturing parentheses will not be penalized. So avoid $&, $', and $` 
    if you can, but if you can't (and some algorithms really appreciate 
    them), once you've used them once, use them at will, because you've 
    already paid the price. As of 5.005, $& is not so costly as the 
    other two."

	We now use another regex. Thanks to matt Lawrence for the help.

2004-02-13 0.3   Fix $1 interference

    Fix the fact that if there was an external match going on else where
    then it would affect our match() method. It uses a nasty hack. 
    Euucch.
